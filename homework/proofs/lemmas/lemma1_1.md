lemma 1.1 If a value type is uniquely represented, equality implies 
representational equality.

Proof.

Suppose a value type is uniquely represented
Let u,v be values of such a value type Type
Suppose u,v are equal
then u,v represent the same entity E

as a value u:={datum(u), interpretation(u)} 
where datum(u) ~ interpretation(u) is a correspondence
analogous forms follow for v

since interpretation(u) = E, it follows that interpretation(v) = E

but datum(u) ~ interpretation(u) is a correspondence

thus datum(u) ~ interpretation(v)
and v:={datum(u), interpretation(u)} follows
